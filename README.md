# ðŸ“Œ Overview
In todayâ€™s evolving brick-and-mortar retail landscape, AI and Augmented Reality are redefining customer engagement and in-store decision-making. This project presents a concrete machine learning use caseâ€”customer churn predictionâ€”based on structured behavioral data. By embedding predictive models into interactive retail systems, we demonstrate how real-time churn risk identification can support personalized interventions and improve customer retention strategies directly at the point of sale.

**Preprocessing: Deal With Missing Data**
- Due to structured nature of the dataset and minimal missingness, we handled missing data using the listwise deletion method, resulting in 7,032 records

- To better capture customer spending behavior, we created a new feature:ðŸ‘‰ AvgMonthlyCharge = TotalCharges / Tenure

# ðŸ§· Feature Engineering

- Based on EDA, I created two new features: average monthly charges and tenure groups. The tenure was categorized into three bins: short-term (<1 year), medium-term (1-4 years), and long-term (>4 years). 
- Based on DAG analysis, I created interaction terms for these variable pairs: Contract * tenure and MonthlyCharges * tenure. Correlation analysis revealed that these interaction variables have meaningful explanatory power for predicting churn behavior.
