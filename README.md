# ðŸ“Œ Overview
In todayâ€™s evolving brick-and-mortar retail landscape, AI and Augmented Reality are redefining customer engagement and in-store decision-making. This project presents a concrete machine learning use caseâ€”customer churn predictionâ€”based on structured behavioral data. By embedding predictive models into interactive retail systems, we demonstrate how real-time churn risk identification can support personalized interventions and improve customer retention strategies directly at the point of sale.
